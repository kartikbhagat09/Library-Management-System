# Library-Management-System
This is a  Library Management System made in python. Both the frontend &amp; backend of this project is created &amp; designed using python. In this project, you can perform actions like add a book, delete a book, view the list of books, issue books to the students and return a book. All this actions we performed in this project with the help of 'bookid' that we gave to each one of the book.
